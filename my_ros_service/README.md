# my_ros_service

This package works in conjuntion with the stdr. The stdr is ran to provide the simulated environment. Next one runs the service. The service will respond that it is ready to accept pathes. Next run the client. All three will run in seperate tabs concurrently. The robot should go from waypoint to waypoint.
